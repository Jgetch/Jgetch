ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm @Jgetch!

I'm a front-end software engineer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional user interfaces. Currently, I'm working on a full-stack project that incorporates the latest GPT3.5 Turbo and DALL-E APIs, exploring new ways to bring AI-powered creativity and innovation to the web.

When I'm not coding, you can find me honing my skills on Codewars as JGetch. While I'm not currently seeking collaboration opportunities, I'm always open to connecting with other developers and sharing ideas.

Thanks for stopping by!
